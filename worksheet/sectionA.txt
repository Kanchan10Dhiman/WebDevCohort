Answers:-
1.A Version Control System (VCS) helps manage changes to source code over time, allowing collaboration, tracking revisions, and restoring previous versions.
2. Centralized VCS uses a single server for all versions, while Distributed VCS (like Git) allows every user to have a full copy of the repository.
3. Git is a distributed version control system; GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories with collaboration features.
4. The staging area in Git is a place where changes are prepared (staged) before committing them to the repository.
5. The .git folder contains all the metadata for a Git repository, including configuration, branches, and history.
6. Git branching allows parallel development. Use `git branch <name>` to create a branch and `git checkout <name>` to switch branches.
7. `git reset` moves the HEAD to a specific commit, while `git reset --hard` also discards all local changes in working directory.
8. A squash merge combines all commits from a branch into one. It’s used to keep the main branch history clean and concise.
9. `git rebase` moves or combines a sequence of commits. For example, to apply feature branch commits on updated main: `git checkout feature`, `git rebase main`.
